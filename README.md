# LASIK Healing Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the quality of healing following LASIK eye surgery. The prediction is based on various patient-specific features such as age, gender, corneal thickness, pre-operative vision, and more.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to assist patients and practitioners by providing a data-driven estimate of healing outcomes after LASIK procedures. The model is trained on historical data using a Random Forest Classifier and incorporates preprocessing techniques to handle class imbalance and optimize prediction accuracy.

## Features

- Predicts healing quality using a trained machine learning model
- Web-based interface for entering user data and receiving predictions
- Interactive front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend powered by Python and scikit-learn
- Model serialization using Joblib
- Ready for deployment as a web application

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Flask 
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
